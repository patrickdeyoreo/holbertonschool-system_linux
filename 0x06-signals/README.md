## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* What is a signal
* Why do they exist
* When are they delivered and by whom
* What are the default actions of signals
* How to set up a handler for a signal
* How to send signals
* What signals can’t be caught

---

### [0. Handle signal](./0-handle_signal.c)
* Write a function that set a handler for the signal SIGINT


### [1. Current handler - signal](./1-current_handler_signal.c)
* Write a function that retrieves the current handler of the signal SIGINT


### [2. Gotta catch them all](./2-handle_sigaction.c)
* Write a function that set a handler for the signal SIGINT


### [3. Current handler - sigaction](./3-current_handler_sigaction.c)
* Write a function that retrieves the current handler of the signal SIGINT


### [4. Who said that?!](./4-trace_signal_sender.c)
* Write a function that defines a handler for the signal SIGQUIT (Control-\ in a shell)


### [5. Description](./5-signal_describe.c)
* Write a program that prints a description of a given signal


### [6. Catch a single time](./6-suspend.c)
* Write a program that sets a handler for the signal SIGINT, and exits right after the signal is received and handled


### [7. Sending a signal](./7-signal_send.c)
* Write a program that sends the signal SIGINT to a process, given its PID


### [8. Sending a signal in a shell](./8-signal_send.sh)
* Write a sh script that sends the signal SIGQUIT to a process, given its PID


### [9. Catch with sh](./9-handle_signal.sh)
* Write a sh script that set a handler for the signals SIGABRT, SIGIO and SIGTERM


### [10. Does it exist?](./10-pid_exist.c)
* Write a function that tests if a process exists, given its PID


### [11. Blog post](./100-all_in_one.c)
* Write a blog post about signals


### [12. I'm saying it's unkillable.](./101-sigset_init.c)
* Write a function that sets up a single handler for all the signals


### [13. Sigset](./102-signals_block.c)
* Write a function that initializes a sigset


### [14. Block signals](./103-signals_unblock.c)
* Write a function that block a given set of signals from being delivered to the current process


### [15. Unblock signals](./104-handle_pending.c)
* Write a function that unblock a given set of signals from being delivered to the current process
