## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your C programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* You are not allowed to have more than 5 functions per file
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called multithreading.h
* Donâ€™t forget to push your header files
* All your header files should be include guarded
* You are allowed to use global variables
* You are allowed to use static functions and variables
